                Living abroad defined my personality the most — I grew up learning about the different cultures, practices and manners of the places I’ve lived in, and became an amalgamation 
                of all these elements. These experiences deeply fostered my wanderlust, and as an adult I spent a lot of my time travelling: I go wherever the wind takes me! 
                (or wherever flight tickets are cheapest) I am fortunate enough to have met some of the most wonderful people on my travels, all of whom I am constantly 
                inspired by. Travelling, to me, is an opportunity to learn something new: be it a language, a skill, or a new art form: each of these elements broadens our 
                understanding of the world and the people outside our immediate circle, but what fascinates me most is how culture shapes the way we think and act. This has ultimately 
                led me to pursue a minor in Sociology and Political Sciences: which I believe will help me deepen my understanding in my areas of interest.<br>

                Besides writing, I can usually be found watching Netflix, scrolling on ClassPass for my next Spin/Boxing class; or running (away from my problems). I enjoy 
                the indulgence that good food and wine brings, and can definitely tell you any coffee’s origin story from just one sip. My sweet tooth also has me constantly on the
                hunt for the best desserts, and if there’s anything certain about me, it’s that I can never say no to a good brunch.
