                Linda Badgley is a writer and photographer from Toronto, Canada. She moved to New York City in 2017 to pursue both a BA in Creative Writing and a 
                BFA in Photography with a minor in sociology. After studying filmmaking for four years in high school, Linda found her passion in film photography and writing.<br>

                With influences ranging from Frank O’Hara to Brendan Behan, Linda writes with a desire to document her experience in a world that is constantly changing. 
                The intersection of art and the political has always stood out to Linda, as that is where the true power of art arises. As a writer for Moonbite, she strives to 
                find that intersection.<br>

                One of the main sources of inspiration for Linda is music, as her vast range of music influences her work. She was raised listening to a wide range of music, 
                from folk to experimental, and has carried that love with her into her young adult years.
