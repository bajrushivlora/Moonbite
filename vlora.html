                Vlora Bajrushi is the graphic designer for MOONBITE and a senior at Parsons School of Design, where she studies Communication Design. 
                Born and raised in NYC, she found herself surrounded with people from all walks of life and cultures who have shaped her character, style, and identity. 
                As a child, Vlora was a quiet and reserved individual, but nevertheless she enjoys meeting new people and making friends. 
                She went through a hefty emo phase between the ages of 8 and 12. 
                Vlora was a devoted runner on the track team in middle school, and recently picked up the hobby again after an 11-year hiatus.
                Her coming-of-age moment occured when she discovered The Weeknd's music at the tender age of 13. 
                She is obsessed with Pure Leaf lemon iced tea and Honey Dijon kettle chips.
                When she turned 19, Vlora decided to devote her life to a new furry family member named Benji whom she loves dearly.
                She enjoys chefing it up in the kitchen, and her greatest aspiration is to be featured in one of her mom's IGTV cooking videos.
                Vlora is excited to help shape MOONBITE into a unique, fun e-magazine platform along with her boss babe team :)
