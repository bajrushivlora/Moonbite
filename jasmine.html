                Jasmine Pereira is the founder and one of the creators for MOONBITE. She is a senior in Parsons School Of Design majoring in Photography and minoring in 
                Fashion Communications. Originally from Hong Kong, she speaks and writes three languages fluently.  By attending an international boarding school in Wales 
                when she was 16, Jasmine learnt more about diversity and all the different cultures of the world. This was where she gradually felt more accepted by her 
                community, and for once her race wasn’t what stood out the most (compared to being in a local school where she was the only brown kid in her grade). This 
                experience has molded and prepared her for her life in New York City. After arriving in New York, she knew instantly this was the place for her; the people, 
                the culture, the vibrance of the city, everything she wished to surround and emerge herself in. Here she discovered a different palette for her taste in music
                - Daniel Caesar, Kanye West, Tyler The Creator, Brockhampton, Frank Ocean and many more. As she turned 22 in the midst of a global pandemic, she was determined 
                to use her online presence as a platform for all kinds of people to showcase their work in all forms. Jasmine was able to meet some of the most incredible people 
                from boarding school in Wales and classes in New York who now work side by side with her developing MOONBITE.
